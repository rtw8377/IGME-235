            <p>
                I am a student currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology and majoring in Game Design and Development. Ever since my childhood I had imagined what it would be like to have my ideas utilized in the games that I play. This is why I chose to go into this field.
                My hope is that I will receive the knowledge I need from the classes here to provide fresh ideas to the gaming industry. My main goal currently is to work for Bungie, whether that be on their new ip or on the Destiny franchise.
